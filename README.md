### Exceltojson.py - Usage:

This script converts the .xlsx file to a .json file and adds the UUID if asked for.
To use it, open a terminal in the directory of the file and enter 'python exceltojson.py' followed by the arguments you want.
Available arguments are:
- -f {filename}
    - To pass the files you want to convert to json files. If not used, the files that will be converted are:
        - 'Classique_Classes.xlsx'
- -c
    - If used, the coefficients of the subjects will not be stored in the json file
- -l
    - If used, the number of lessons per subject won't be stored in the json file
- -s
    - If used, no subsubjects will be stored but only the main subject that is composed of the subsubjects
- -u
    - If used, each class, subject and subsubject will get an UUID in the json file like follows: 'id': 'UUID'
